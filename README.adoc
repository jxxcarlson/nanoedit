This project demonstrates a bug in Elm.

To run the project, cd into this directory,
execute `elm-reactor`, go to `localhost:8000`
in your browser, and select `Main.elm`

To demonstrate the bug, edit the selected document
in the yellow textarea, then select the other document.
You will notice that the change is reflected in the title
and in the gray text window, but not the yellow textarea.
