Version 3.2 of mdgriffith/style-elements package
allows one to work around the jumping cursor
bug in a convenient way that does not introduce
additional misbehavior.  See the code for
`renderInput` and its use, lines 68-73
of `Main.elm`.

The fix relies on the use of `Element.Keyed`, and
follows the solution in Ellie: https://ellie-app.com/3yQr7JP82BPa1/7
Many thanks to Matthew Griffith for help with this.

To run the project, cd into this directory,
execute `elm-reactor`, go to `localhost:8000`
in your browser, and select `Main.elm`


*Note.*  The use of `counter` appears to be essential.
Probably some weird stuff in the virtual DOM that I don't understand.
